**CommonGen** is a new _constrained text generation_ dataset that requires different kinds of commonsense to generate sentences about everyday scenarios, and thus targets **generative commonsense reasoning**. This repo is for tracking the latest dataset, some baseline models and our evaluation scripts. Please check [http://inklab.usc.edu/CommonGen/](http://inklab.usc.edu/CommonGen/) for more details. Note that our [arxiv article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03705) may contain some _outdated_ statistics and information.

- `methods` shows some baseline methods with many frameworks such as OpenNMT and Fariseq, as well as UniLM.

- `evaluation` contains the evaluation scripts for a variety of automatic metrics for testing the performance of system predictions against human-written results.
