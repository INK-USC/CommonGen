    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going deep into any Machine Learning or Deep Learning Natural Language Processing models, every practitioner\n",
    "should find a way to map raw input strings to a representation understandable by a trainable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "One very simple approach would be to split inputs over every space and assign an identifier to each word. This approach\n",
    "would look similar to the code below in python\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = \"very long corpus...\"\n",
    "words = s.split(\" \")  # Split over space\n",
    "vocabulary = dict(enumerate(set(words)))  # Map storing the word to it's corresponding id\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach might work well if your vocabulary remains small as it would store every word (or **token**) present in your original\n",
    "input. Moreover, word variations like \"cat\" and \"cats\" would not share the same identifiers even if their meaning is \n",
    "quite close.\n",

    "### Subtoken Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome the issues described above, recent works have been done on tokenization, leveraging \"subtoken\" tokenization.\n",
    "**Subtokens** extends the previous splitting strategy to furthermore explode a word into grammatically logicial sub-components learned\n",
    "from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking our previous example of the words __cat__ and __cats__, a sub-tokenization of the word __cats__ would be [cat, ##s]. Where the prefix _\"##\"_ indicates a subtoken of the initial input. \n",
    "Such training algorithms might extract sub-tokens such as _\"##ing\"_, _\"##ed\"_ over English corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might think of, this kind of sub-tokens construction leveraging compositions of _\"pieces\"_ overall reduces the size\n",
    "of the vocabulary you have to carry to train a Machine Learning model. On the other side, as one token might be exploded\n",
    "into multiple subtokens, the input of your model might increase and become an issue on model with non-linear complexity over the input sequence's length. \n",
    " \n",
    "![subtokenization](https://nlp.fast.ai/images/multifit_vocabularies.png)\n",
    " \n",
    "Among all the tokenization algorithms, we can highlight a few subtokens algorithms used in Transformers-based SoTA models : \n",

    "### @huggingface/tokenizers library \n",
    "Along with the transformers library, we @huggingface provide a blazing fast tokenization library\n",
    "able to train, tokenize and decode dozens of Gb/s of text on a common multi-core machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library is written in Rust allowing us to take full advantage of multi-core parallel computations in a native and memory-aware way, on-top of which \n",
    "we provide bindings for Python and NodeJS (more bindings may be added in the future). \n",
    "\n",
    "We designed the library so that it provides all the required blocks to create end-to-end tokenizers in an interchangeable way. In that sense, we provide\n",
    "these various components: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalizer**: Executes all the initial transformations over the initial input string. For example when you need to\n",
    "lowercase some text, maybe strip it, or even apply one of the common unicode normalization process, you will add a Normalizer. \n",
    "- **PreTokenizer**: In charge of splitting the initial input string. That's the component that decides where and how to\n",
    "pre-segment the origin string. The simplest example would be like we saw before, to simply split on spaces.\n",
    "- **Model**: Handles all the sub-token discovery and generation, this part is trainable and really dependant\n",
    " of your input data.\n",
    "- **Post-Processor**: Provides advanced construction features to be compatible with some of the Transformers-based SoTA\n",
    "models. For instance, for BERT it would wrap the tokenized sentence around [CLS] and [SEP] tokens.\n",
    "- **Decoder**: In charge of mapping back a tokenized input to the original string. The decoder is usually chosen according\n",
    "to the `PreTokenizer` we used previously.\n",
    "- **Trainer**: Provides training capabilities to each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the components above we provide multiple implementations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalizer**: Lowercase, Unicode (NFD, NFKD, NFC, NFKC), Bert, Strip, ...\n",
    "- **PreTokenizer**: ByteLevel, WhitespaceSplit, CharDelimiterSplit, Metaspace, ...\n",
    "- **Model**: WordLevel, BPE, WordPiece\n",
    "- **Post-Processor**: BertProcessor, ...\n",
    "- **Decoder**: WordLevel, BPE, WordPiece, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these building blocks can be combined to create working tokenization pipelines. \n",
