    "## Introduction\n",
    "The transformers library is an open-source, community-based repository to train, use and share models based on \n",
    "the Transformer architecture [(Vaswani & al., 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) such as Bert [(Devlin & al., 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805),\n",
    "Roberta [(Liu & al., 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692), GPT2 [(Radford & al., 2019)](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf),\n",
    "XLNet [(Yang & al., 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237), etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Along with the models, the library contains multiple variations of each of them for a large variety of \n",
    "downstream-tasks like **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**, **Sentiment Analysis**, \n",
    "**Language Modeling**, **Question Answering** and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to 2017, most of the people using Neural Networks when working on Natural Language Processing were relying on \n",
    "sequential processing of the input through [Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network).\n",
    "\n",
    "![rnn](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/img/RNN-general.png)   \n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs were performing well on large variety of tasks involving sequential dependency over the input sequence. \n",
    "However, this sequentially-dependent process had issues modeling very long range dependencies and \n",
    "was not well suited for the kind of hardware we're currently leveraging due to bad parallelization capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some extensions were provided by the academic community, such as Bidirectional RNN ([Schuster & Paliwal., 1997](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3316656_Bidirectional_recurrent_neural_networks), [Graves & al., 2005](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1290195/file.pdf)), \n",
    "which can be seen as a concatenation of two sequential process, one going forward, the other one going backward over the sequence input.\n",
    "\n",
    "![birnn](https://miro.medium.com/max/764/1*6QnPUSv_t9BY9Fv8_aLb-Q.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And also, the Attention mechanism, which introduced a good improvement over \"raw\" RNNs by giving \n",
    "a learned, weighted-importance to each element in the sequence, allowing the model to focus on important elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "![attention_rnn](https://3qeqpr26caki16dnhd19sv6by6v-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Example-of-Attention.png)  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Then comes the Transformer  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformers era originally started from the work of [(Vaswani & al., 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) who\n",
    "demonstrated its superiority over [Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)\n",
    "on translation tasks but it quickly extended to almost all the tasks RNNs were State-of-the-Art at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of Transformer over its RNN counterpart was its non sequential attention model. Remember, the RNNs had to\n",
    "iterate over each element of the input sequence one-by-one and carry an \"updatable-state\" between each hop. With Transformer, the model is able to look at every position in the sequence, at the same time, in one operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a deep-dive into the Transformer architecture, [The Annotated Transformer](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html#encoder-and-decoder-stacks) \n",
    "will drive you along all the details of the paper.\n",

    "\n",
    "For the rest of this notebook, we will use the [BERT (Devlin & al., 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) architecture, as it's the most simple and there are plenty of content about it\n",
