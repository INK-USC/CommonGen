# ü§ó + üìö dbmdz German BERT models

In this repository the MDZ Digital Library team (dbmdz) at the Bavarian State
Library open sources another German BERT models üéâ

# German BERT

## Stats

In addition to the recently released [German BERT](https://deepset.ai/german-bert)
model by [deepset](https://deepset.ai/) we provide another German-language model.

The source data for the model consists of a recent Wikipedia dump, EU Bookshop corpus,
Open Subtitles, CommonCrawl, ParaCrawl and News Crawl. This results in a dataset with
a size of 16GB and 2,350,234,427 tokens.

For sentence splitting, we use [spacy](https://spacy.io/). Our preprocessing steps
(sentence piece model for vocab generation) follow those used for training
[SciBERT](https://github.com/allenai/scibert). The model is trained with an initial
sequence length of 512 subwords and was performed for 1.5M steps.

This release includes both cased and uncased models.

## Model weights

Currently only PyTorch-[Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
compatible weights are available. If you need access to TensorFlow checkpoints,
please raise an issue!

## Usage

With Transformers >= 2.3 our German BERT models can be loaded like:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("dbmdz/bert-base-german-cased")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("dbmdz/bert-base-german-cased")
```
