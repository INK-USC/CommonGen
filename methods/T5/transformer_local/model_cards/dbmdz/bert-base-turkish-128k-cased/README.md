# ü§ó + üìö dbmdz Turkish BERT model

In this repository the MDZ Digital Library team (dbmdz) at the Bavarian State
Library open sources a cased model for Turkish üéâ

# üáπüá∑ BERTurk

BERTurk is a community-driven cased BERT model for Turkish.

Some datasets used for pretraining and evaluation are contributed from the
awesome Turkish NLP community, as well as the decision for the model name: BERTurk.

## Stats

The current version of the model is trained on a filtered and sentence
segmented version of the Turkish [OSCAR corpus](https://traces1.inria.fr/oscar/),
a recent Wikipedia dump, various [OPUS corpora](http://opus.nlpl.eu/) and a
special corpus provided by [Kemal Oflazer](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/ko/).

The final training corpus has a size of 35GB and 44,04,976,662 tokens.

Thanks to Google's TensorFlow Research Cloud (TFRC) we could train a cased model
on a TPU v3-8 for 2M steps.

For this model we use a vocab size of 128k.

## Model weights

Currently only PyTorch-[Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
compatible weights are available. If you need access to TensorFlow checkpoints,
please raise an issue!

## Usage

With Transformers >= 2.3 our BERTurk cased model can be loaded like:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-128k-cased")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-128k-cased")
```
