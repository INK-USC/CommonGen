# ü§ó + üìö dbmdz BERT models

In this repository the MDZ Digital Library team (dbmdz) at the Bavarian State
Library open sources German Europeana BERT models üéâ

# German Europeana BERT

We use the open source [Europeana newspapers](http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/)
that were provided by *The European Library*. The final
training corpus has a size of 51GB and consists of 8,035,986,369 tokens.

Detailed information about the data and pretraining steps can be found in
[this repository](https://github.com/stefan-it/europeana-bert).

## Model weights

Currently only PyTorch-[Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
compatible weights are available. If you need access to TensorFlow checkpoints,
please raise an issue!

## Results

For results on Historic NER, please refer to [this repository](https://github.com/stefan-it/europeana-bert).

## Usage

With Transformers >= 2.3 our German Europeana BERT models can be loaded like:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("dbmdz/bert-base-german-europeana-uncased")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("dbmdz/bert-base-german-europeana-uncased")
```

# Huggingface model hub

All models are available on the [Huggingface model hub](https://huggingface.co/dbmdz).
