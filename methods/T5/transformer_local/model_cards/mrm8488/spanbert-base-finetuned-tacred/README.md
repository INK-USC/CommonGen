# SpanBERT base fine-tuned on TACRED

[SpanBERT](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SpanBERT) created by [Facebook Research](https://github.com/facebookresearch) and fine-tuned on [TACRED](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/tacred/) dataset by [them](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SpanBERT#finetuned-models-squad-1120-relation-extraction-coreference-resolution)

## Details of SpanBERT

[SpanBERT: Improving Pre-training by Representing and Predicting Spans](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10529)

## Dataset üìö

[TACRED](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/tacred/) A large-scale relation extraction dataset with 106k+ examples over 42 TAC KBP relation types.

## Model fine-tuning üèãÔ∏è‚Äç

You can get the fine-tuning script [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SpanBERT)

```bash
python code/run_tacred.py \
  --do_train \

  --data_dir <TACRED_DATA_DIR> \
  --model spanbert-base-cased \
  --train_batch_size 32 \
  --eval_batch_size 32 \
  --learning_rate 2e-5 \
  --num_train_epochs 10 \
  --max_seq_length 128 \
  --output_dir tacred_dir \
  --fp16
```
