# rubert-base-cased-sentence

Sentence RuBERT \(Russian, cased, 12-layer, 768-hidden, 12-heads, 180M parameters\) is a representation‑based sentence encoder for Russian. It is initialized with RuBERT and fine‑tuned on SNLI\[1\] google-translated to russian and on russian part of XNLI dev set\[2\]. Sentence representations are mean pooled token embeddings in the same manner as in Sentence‑BERT\[3\].
