# rubert-base-cased-conversational

Conversational RuBERT \(Russian, cased, 12‑layer, 768‑hidden, 12‑heads, 180M parameters\) was trained on OpenSubtitles\[1\], [Dirty](https://d3.ru/), [Pikabu](https://pikabu.ru/), and a Social Media segment of Taiga corpus\[2\]. We assembled a new vocabulary for Conversational RuBERT model on this data and initialized the model with [RuBERT](../rubert-base-cased).
