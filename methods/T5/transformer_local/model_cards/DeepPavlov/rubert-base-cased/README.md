# rubert-base-cased

RuBERT \(Russian, cased, 12‑layer, 768‑hidden, 12‑heads, 180M parameters\) was trained on the Russian part of Wikipedia and news data. We used this training data to build a vocabulary of Russian subtokens and took a multilingual version of BERT‑base as an initialization for RuBERT\[1\].
