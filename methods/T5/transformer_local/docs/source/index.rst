Transformers
================================================================================================================================================

ü§ó Transformers (formerly known as `pytorch-transformers` and `pytorch-pretrained-bert`) provides general-purpose architectures
(BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, XLM, DistilBert, XLNet...) for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation
(NLG) with over 32+ pretrained models in 100+ languages and deep interoperability between TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch.

This is the documentation of our repository `transformers <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers>`__.

Features
---------------------------------------------------

- As easy to use as pytorch-transformers
- As powerful and concise as Keras
- High performance on NLU and NLG tasks
- Low barrier to entry for educators and practitioners

State-of-the-art NLP for everyone:

- Deep learning researchers
- Hands-on practitioners
- AI/ML/NLP teachers and educators

Lower compute costs, smaller carbon footprint:

- Researchers can share trained models instead of always retraining
- Practitioners can reduce compute time and production costs
- 8 architectures with over 30 pretrained models, some in more than 100 languages

Choose the right framework for every part of a model's lifetime:

- Train state-of-the-art models in 3 lines of code
- Deep interoperability between TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch models
- Move a single model between TF2.0/PyTorch frameworks at will
- Seamlessly pick the right framework for training, evaluation, production
